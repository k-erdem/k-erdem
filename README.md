### Hi, I'm Kaan ðŸ‘‹

I'm a Software Engineer and a young Columbia alum. Iâ€™m curious, human-oriented, and positively persistent in making fun, interesting, and impactful ideas work. My interests include full-stack development, AI, and human-centered design. You can find my resume [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1o37Ptgi0jqB0BcxxY7YQRz1sUP5dgieo/view?usp=sharing).
